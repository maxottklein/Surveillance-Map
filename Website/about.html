					The Internet is a fundamentally decentralized system that links billions of inter-connected devices to improve communication, access to information, and economic possibilities for billions of people across the globe. As people spend ever more of their time engaging with online services, the volume and importance of the data created from these interactions simultaneously increases. Yet despite its distributed nature, giant technology companies have used the underlying technical protocols to build layers of proprietary applications that capture and control massive amounts of personal data. In her book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Shoshana Zuboff refers in this regard to the Surveillance Capitalism, a system that uses the invasive forces of the Internet as a source of capital formation and wealth creation.

					With this project I want to pursue the question of how I may create a visual experiment that reflects on the visible and invisible procedures and mechanisms of the Surveillance Economy. Furthermore, I'm exploring how I may gain novel insights into my personal commitments to the system of Surveillance Capitalism?
